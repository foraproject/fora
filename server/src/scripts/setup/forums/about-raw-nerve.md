The last time I wrote about two nonprofits, someone commented to say they were “outright nauseated” by my post.
“The website is not the place to signal humility and argue against your own conclusions. All that would demonstrate is naivety and incompetence,” they insisted.
And maybe they’re right: maybe having a mistakes page at the top of your website goes much too far."
