    I’ve noticed that some people have complimented my series Raw Nerve by saying it’s a great explanation of cognitive
    biases. Which always amuses me, since the series grew out of frustrations I had with the usual way that term gets
    used. There’s a group of people (call them the cognitive bias community) who say the way to be more rational — to
    get better at making decisions that get you what you want — is to work at overcoming your biases. But if you’re
    overcoming biases, surely there are some lessons that will help you more than others.
